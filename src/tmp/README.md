# common-project-back-front WIP

This project is a common project for back and front.

Initially this project is being done by using a litte example of a simple project which is based on the index.html file.

The current work in progress is being done in the demo.html file.

## How to run

To run this project, you need to have the following tools installed:

- Node.js
- npm

After installing the tools, you can run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

## How to use the app

After running the project, you can access the following URL in your browser:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

If the port is already in use, you need to check the console to see which port is being used, you will see a message like this one below:

```bash
   ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │                                                  │
   │   Serving!                                       │
   │                                                  │
   │   - Local:    http://localhost:60210             │
   │   - Network:  http://192.168.1.140:60210         │
   │                                                  │
   │   This port was picked because 3000 is in use.   │
   │                                                  │
   │   Copied local address to clipboard!             │
   │                                                  │
   └──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Then go to the browser and access the URL with the port that is being used.

For original app use the following URL:

```bash
http://localhost:3000/index.html
```

For the demo app use the following URL:

```bash
http://localhost:3000/demo.html
```
